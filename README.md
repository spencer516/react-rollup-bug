This is a simple template for building a React app with Rollup. Do this...

```bash
git clone https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/cb14f4bc0670c47d00d191565be36bf0 react-rollup
cd react-rollup
npm install
npm run dev
```

...then open index.html to see the Hello World application. `npm run build` will build the app with React in production mode, and minify the result.
